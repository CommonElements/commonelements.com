If your community association is paying for property insurance in Florida and you haven't had a wind mitigation inspection — or it's been several years since your last one — you may be overpaying for coverage.

Wind mitigation credits are premium discounts mandated by Florida law that reward buildings with construction features designed to resist hurricane-force winds. For a mid-rise or high-rise condominium, these credits can reduce the wind portion of your property insurance premium by 20% or more. On a policy with a six-figure premium, that's a significant number.

## How Wind Mitigation Credits Work

Florida Statute 627.0629 requires property insurers to provide premium discounts for buildings that incorporate specific wind-resistant construction features. The theory is straightforward: buildings built to withstand high winds file fewer claims, so they should cost less to insure.

The credits are applied based on a standardized inspection performed by a qualified inspector — typically a licensed general contractor, building contractor, architect, engineer, or building inspector. The inspector completes a **Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection Form (OIR-B1-1802)**, which evaluates your building across several categories.

The form is submitted to your insurance carrier, which applies the applicable credits to your premium calculation.

## What the Inspector Evaluates

The wind mitigation inspection looks at five primary building characteristics:

### 1. Roof Covering

The inspector determines what type of roof covering is installed and whether it meets the Florida Building Code (FBC) or Miami-Dade standards. Buildings with roof coverings that meet FBC 2001 or later standards receive the largest credit in this category.

For associations with flat or low-slope roofs (common on mid-rise and high-rise buildings), the roof membrane type and its compliance rating matter. A roof installed or replaced after March 1, 2002, under permit, generally qualifies for the credit.

**Key takeaway:** If your association has replaced or significantly repaired its roof in the last 20 years, confirm that the permit was pulled and the work meets FBC standards. The permit history is what the inspector needs.

### 2. Roof Deck Attachment

This measures how the roof decking (the structural layer beneath the roof covering) is attached to the roof framing. Stronger attachment methods — specifically those using 8d ring-shank nails at 6-inch spacing or structural adhesive — earn better credits.

For concrete and steel-frame high-rises with poured concrete roof decks, this category typically results in a strong credit by default, since the roof deck is integral to the structure.

### 3. Roof-to-Wall Connection

This evaluates how the roof structure is connected to the exterior walls. The strongest connections — clips, single wraps, and double wraps — resist uplift forces better than toe-nailing alone.

Hurricane straps or clips connecting roof trusses to the wall system are a significant credit driver for wood-frame buildings. For concrete and steel structures, the inherent connection method usually qualifies for the best available credit.

### 4. Roof Geometry

Hip roofs (where all sides slope downward) perform better in high winds than gable roofs. A building where 100% of the roof perimeter is hip geometry receives the maximum credit in this category.

Many condominium buildings have flat roofs with parapet walls, which typically qualify favorably. The specific classification depends on the parapet height relative to the roof surface.

### 5. Opening Protection

This evaluates whether the building's exterior openings — windows, sliding glass doors, entry doors, and garage doors — are protected against windborne debris. There are two levels:

- **Basic windborne debris protection** — all openings are protected by shutters or impact-rated assemblies that meet the large missile test standard
- **No protection** — unprotected openings or partial protection

For condominiums and high-rises, the presence of hurricane shutters or impact-rated windows and doors across the entire building can generate one of the largest individual credits on the form. This is often the most actionable category for boards considering capital improvements.

## How Much Can Credits Save?

The exact savings depend on your building's characteristics, location, and carrier, but typical ranges for Florida coastal associations:

- **Full credits across all categories:** 25–45% reduction in the wind premium component
- **Partial credits (some categories qualifying):** 10–25% reduction
- **No credits (pre-2002 construction, no improvements):** You're paying the base rate

On a master property policy with a $200,000 annual premium where 60% is attributable to wind exposure, full mitigation credits could save $30,000 to $54,000 per year. Over a five-year policy cycle, that's $150,000 to $270,000 in cumulative savings.

## Common Issues That Reduce or Eliminate Credits

Several situations can cost your association credits it might otherwise qualify for:

**Missing permit documentation.** The inspector needs to verify that roof work was performed under permit and to code. If your association replaced its roof but can't produce the permit, the inspector may not be able to certify the work meets FBC standards.

**Partial opening protection.** If 95% of your windows have impact glass but 5% don't, the building may not qualify for the opening protection credit. The standard typically requires all openings to be protected.

**Outdated inspections.** If your last wind mitigation inspection was done before significant building improvements (new roof, impact windows), you're likely missing credits you now qualify for.

**Incorrect form completion.** Not all inspectors are equally thorough. An incomplete or incorrectly completed form can result in missed credits. Consider working with an inspector who specializes in commercial and multi-unit buildings.

## When to Get a New Inspection

You should request a new wind mitigation inspection if:

- Your building has **never had one** performed
- You've **replaced the roof** since the last inspection
- You've **installed impact windows or hurricane shutters** since the last inspection
- Your last inspection is **more than five years old** (carriers may require a current one)
- You're **switching carriers** and the new carrier requires a current form

The cost of a wind mitigation inspection for a multi-unit building typically ranges from $150 to $500, depending on the building size and complexity. Given the potential premium savings, the return on investment is usually significant.

## Action Steps for Your Board

1. **Find your current wind mitigation form.** Ask your agent or carrier for the most recent OIR-B1-1802 on file. Review it to confirm it accurately reflects your building's current condition.

2. **Identify improvement opportunities.** If your building doesn't qualify for opening protection credits, calculate the cost of impact windows or shutters against the premium savings over 10 to 15 years.

3. **Schedule an inspection if needed.** If you don't have a current form, or if improvements have been made since the last one, hire a qualified inspector.

4. **Submit the form to your carrier.** Credits aren't applied automatically. Your agent needs to submit the completed form to the carrier for the credits to be reflected in your premium.

5. **Review at every renewal.** Confirm that your wind mitigation credits are being applied correctly each year. Credits that were applied one year can occasionally be dropped at renewal if the form expires or is lost in a system migration.
